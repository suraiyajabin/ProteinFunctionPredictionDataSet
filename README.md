# ProteinFunctionPredictionDataSet

This data repository contains full Training and Test datasets for our publshed work titled "A deep neural network based model for function prediction of hypothetical proteins from pathogenic bacterial species" in the journal CBAC, Springer.

Here we put complete Training and Test dataset for people refering to our protein function prediction project designed for function prediction of unreviewed hypothetical proteins of 9 bacterial phyla namely Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Tenericutes.

Supplementary Dataset 2: feature vectors extracted from reviewed proteins (75% of 1,71,212 reviewed proteins) of 9 Bacterial phyla. 
Supplementary Dataset 3: Test Dataset 1 with feature vectors extracted from reviewed proteins (25% of 1,71,212 reviewed proteins) 9 Bacterial phyla. 

Datasets are in TSV/Excel format all zipped individually.
